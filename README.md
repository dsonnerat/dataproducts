#Coursera project assignment for data products class

##This shiny application has the following behavior:

This site allows you to specify normal distribution mean and standard deviation.
You also have to give an interval. The normal distribution probability density function
calculated within the interval is then plotted and the probability to have a value
within this interval is also calculated.

To make it work you have to:
 - Select the mean of the normal distribution.
 - Select the standard deviation or the normal distribution.
 - Select the min of the interval.
 - Select the max of the interval.
 
The système will automatically plot the normal distribution probability density function
and calculate the probability.

You can access the site using the following URL:
